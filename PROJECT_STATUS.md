#### Ranking Logic Validation ✅
**Requirement**: Rank by score (primary), then submission time (secondary)

**Implementation**:
```sql
ORDER BY totalScore DESC, submittedAt ASC
```

**Tie-Breaking Scenarios**:
- Same score, different times: Earlier submission ranks higher ✅
- Different scores: Higher score ranks first (time irrelevant) ✅
- All same score and time: Sequential ranking ✅
- Event-wide: Aggregates scores across all rounds ✅
