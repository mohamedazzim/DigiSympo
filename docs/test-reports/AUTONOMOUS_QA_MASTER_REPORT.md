## SECTION 4: AUTO-FIXES APPLIED

### Summary

**Total Auto-Fixes:** 4  
**Security Vulnerabilities:** 3  
**Synchronization Issues:** 1  
**All Fixes:** ✅ Successfully Applied and Verified

---

### Fix #1: Registration Committee Admin Route Access

**Issue ID:** RBAC-001  
**Severity:** HIGH 🔴  
**Category:** Security Vulnerability  
**Discovery Date:** October 3, 2025

#### Problem Description
Registration committee users could access the `/api/users` endpoint, which is intended for Super Admins only. This allowed unauthorized viewing of all user accounts in the system.

#### Root Cause
The `/api/users` endpoint was protected only with `requireAuth` middleware, which validates authentication but not role-based authorization.

#### Fix Applied
```typescript
// BEFORE (Vulnerable):
app.get("/api/users", requireAuth, async (req, res) => {
  const users = await storage.getAllUsers();
  res.json(users);
});

// AFTER (Secured):
app.get("/api/users", requireAuth, requireSuperAdmin, async (req, res) => {
  const users = await storage.getAllUsers();
  res.json(users);
});
```

#### File Modified
`server/routes.ts` (line 134)

#### Verification
- ✅ Super Admin: Returns 200 OK with user list
- ✅ Event Admin: Returns 403 Forbidden
- ✅ Registration Committee: Returns 403 Forbidden
- ✅ Participant: Returns 403 Forbidden

#### Impact
- **Before:** Registration committee could see all user accounts
- **After:** Only Super Admins can access user list
- **Data Exposed:** None (fixed before production)

---

### Fix #2: Participants Could Create Rounds

**Issue ID:** RBAC-002  
**Severity:** HIGH 🔴  
**Category:** Security Vulnerability  
**Discovery Date:** October 3, 2025

#### Problem Description
Participant users could create unauthorized test rounds via POST `/api/events/:eventId/rounds`, potentially disrupting event management.

#### Root Cause
The round creation endpoint was missing the `requireEventAdmin` middleware, allowing any authenticated user to create rounds.

#### Fix Applied
```typescript
// BEFORE (Vulnerable):
app.post("/api/events/:eventId/rounds", requireAuth, async (req, res) => {
  // Round creation logic
});

// AFTER (Secured):
app.post("/api/events/:eventId/rounds", requireAuth, requireEventAdmin, requireEventAccess, async (req, res) => {
  // Round creation logic
});
```

#### File Modified
`server/routes.ts` (line 456)

#### Verification
- ✅ Super Admin: Returns 201 Created
- ✅ Event Admin (assigned): Returns 201 Created
- ✅ Event Admin (not assigned): Returns 403 Forbidden
- ✅ Registration Committee: Returns 403 Forbidden
- ✅ Participant: Returns 403 Forbidden

#### Impact
- **Before:** Any participant could create rounds
- **After:** Only authorized admins can create rounds
- **Unauthorized Rounds Created:** None (fixed during testing)

---

### Fix #3: Participants Could Delete Rounds

**Issue ID:** RBAC-003  
**Severity:** HIGH 🔴  
**Category:** Security Vulnerability  
**Discovery Date:** October 3, 2025

#### Problem Description
Participant users could delete test rounds via DELETE `/api/rounds/:roundId`, potentially destroying test data and disrupting events.

#### Root Cause
The DELETE endpoint for rounds was not implemented with proper middleware protection, defaulting to allowing any authenticated user.

#### Fix Applied
```typescript
// BEFORE (Vulnerable):
// Route not explicitly defined, fell through to default handler

// AFTER (Secured):
app.delete(
  "/api/rounds/:roundId",
  requireAuth,
  requireEventAdmin,
  requireRoundAccess,
  async (req, res) => {
    const roundId = req.params.roundId;
    await storage.deleteRound(roundId);
    res.json({ message: "Round deleted successfully" });
  }
);
```

#### File Modified
`server/routes.ts` (added new route at line 672)

#### Verification
- ✅ Super Admin: Returns 200 OK
- ✅ Event Admin (assigned): Returns 200 OK
- ✅ Event Admin (not assigned): Returns 403 Forbidden
- ✅ Registration Committee: Returns 403 Forbidden
- ✅ Participant: Returns 403 Forbidden

#### Impact
- **Before:** Participants could delete any round
- **After:** Only authorized admins can delete rounds
- **Rounds Deleted:** None (fixed during testing)

### Fix #4: Event Admin Rounds Page Not Auto-Updating

**Issue ID:** SYNC-001  
**Severity:** MEDIUM 🟡  
**Category:** Synchronization Issue  
**Discovery Date:** October 3, 2025

#### Problem Description
After clicking Start/End/Restart round buttons, the Event Admin rounds list did not automatically update. Admins had to manually refresh the browser to see status changes, even though the live timer was updating correctly.

#### Root Cause
The rounds query in `EventRoundsPage` component was missing the `refetchInterval` configuration, preventing automatic polling.

#### Fix Applied
```typescript
// BEFORE (Broken):
const { data: rounds, isLoading: roundsLoading } = useQuery<Round[]>({
  queryKey: ['/api/events', eventId, 'rounds'],
  enabled: !!eventId,
  // Missing: refetchInterval
});

// AFTER (Fixed):
const { data: rounds, isLoading: roundsLoading } = useQuery<Round[]>({
  queryKey: ['/api/events', eventId, 'rounds'],
  enabled: !!eventId,
  refetchInterval: 5000,  // ← ADDED: Poll every 5 seconds
});
```

#### File Modified
`client/src/pages/event-admin/event-rounds.tsx` (line 105)

#### Verification
- ✅ Round status updates within 5 seconds after Start/End/Restart
- ✅ Status badges (Not Started, In Progress, Completed) update automatically
- ✅ Action buttons (Start/End/Restart) appear/disappear correctly
- ✅ Timer continues to update every 1 second (unchanged)
- ✅ No manual browser refresh required

#### Impact
- **Before:** Admin UI felt unresponsive, required manual refresh
- **After:** UI updates automatically within 5 seconds
- **User Experience:** Significantly improved, matches participant UI behavior

#### Additional Context
This fix brings the Event Admin UI in line with the Participant UI polling strategy:
- Participant Dashboard: polls `/api/participants/my-credential` every 5s
- Participant Event Details: polls `/api/events/:id/rounds` every 5s
- Participant Take Test: polls `/api/rounds/:id` every 5s
- **Event Admin Rounds:** NOW polls `/api/events/:id/rounds` every 5s ✅

### 5.2 Round Status Synchronization

#### Start Round Flow ✅

**Backend Operations:**
1. Updates round status to `in_progress`
2. Sets `startedAt` timestamp
3. Automatically sets `testEnabled=true` for ALL event participants

**Expected Timeline:**
- T+0s: Admin clicks "Start Round" button
- T+0-5s: Participant dashboard polls `/api/participants/my-credential`
- T+0-5s: Participant sees `testEnabled=true` and active round
- T+0-5s: "Begin Test" button becomes enabled

**UI Updates Verified:**
- ✅ Admin: Round status badge → "In Progress"
- ✅ Admin: Timer starts counting down
- ✅ Admin: "Start" button → "End" button
- ✅ Participant Dashboard: Alert disappears
- ✅ Participant Dashboard: "Begin Test" enabled
- ✅ Participant Event Details: Round badge → "in_progress"
- ✅ Participant Event Details: "Take Test" enabled

#### End Round Flow ✅

**Backend Operations:**
1. Updates round status to `completed`
2. Sets `endedAt` timestamp

**Expected Timeline:**
- T+0s: Admin clicks "End Round" button
- T+0-5s: Participant event details detects status='completed'
- T+0-5s: Active test page detects round ended
- T+2s: Auto-submit triggered (after 2s delay)

**UI Updates Verified:**
- ✅ Admin: Round status badge → "Completed"
- ✅ Admin: Timer → "Completed"
- ✅ Admin: "End" button → "Restart" button
- ✅ Participant Event Details: Round badge → "completed"
- ✅ Participant Event Details: "Completed" button (disabled)
- ✅ Participant Take Test: Toast notification appears
- ✅ Participant Take Test: Auto-submits and navigates to results

#### Restart Round Flow ✅

**Backend Operations:**
1. Deletes all test attempts for the round
2. Resets round status to `not_started`
3. Clears `startedAt` and `endedAt` timestamps
4. Sets `testEnabled=false` for ALL participants

**UI Updates Verified:**
- ✅ Admin: Round status badge → "Not Started"
- ✅ Admin: Timer → "-- : --"
- ✅ Admin: "Restart" → "Start" button
- ✅ Participant Dashboard: Alert shows "Waiting for admin to enable test"
- ✅ Participant Dashboard: "Begin Test" disabled
- ✅ Participant Event Details: Round badge → "not_started"

### 5.3 Test Enablement Synchronization ✅

**Mechanism:**
- Admin starts round → Backend sets `testEnabled=true` for all event credentials
- Participant dashboard polls every 5 seconds → Detects enabled status
- "Begin Test" button enables within 0-5 seconds

**Verification:**
- ✅ Polling interval: 5 seconds
- ✅ Maximum sync delay: 5 seconds
- ✅ Average sync delay: 2.5 seconds

### 5.4 Active Test Auto-Submit ✅

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Polls round status every 5 seconds during test
const { data: currentRound } = useQuery<Round>({
  queryKey: ['/api/rounds', attempt?.roundId],
  enabled: !!attempt?.roundId && hasStarted,
  refetchInterval: 5000,
});

// Detects round end and auto-submits
useEffect(() => {
  if (currentRound?.status === 'completed' && attempt?.status === 'in_progress' && hasStarted) {
    toast({
      title: 'Round Ended',
      description: 'The admin has ended this round. Your test will be auto-submitted.',
      variant: 'destructive',
    });
    setTimeout(() => submitTestMutation.mutate(), 2000);
  }
}, [currentRound?.status, attempt?.status, hasStarted]);
```

**Timeline:**
- T+0s: Admin clicks "End Round"
- T+0-5s: Participant detects status='completed' via polling
- T+0-5s: Toast notification appears
- T+2-7s: Auto-submit triggered (0-5s polling + 2s intentional delay)

**Verification:**
- ✅ Total delay: 2-7 seconds (acceptable)
- ✅ Notification shows correct message
- ✅ Navigation redirects to results page
- ✅ Answers saved before submission

### 5.5 Live Timer Functionality ✅

**Event Admin Countdown Timer:**

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const calculateTimeRemaining = () => {
  const now = new Date().getTime();
  const startedAt = new Date(round.startedAt!).getTime();
  const durationMs = round.duration * 60 * 1000;
  const elapsed = now - startedAt;
  const remaining = Math.max(0, durationMs - elapsed);
  return Math.floor(remaining / 1000);
};

// Updates every 1 second
const interval = setInterval(() => {
  setTimeRemaining(calculateTimeRemaining());
}, 1000);
```

**Color Coding Rules:**

| Time Remaining | Color | Display |
|---------------|-------|---------|
| > 15 minutes | Green | MM:SS or Hh Mm |
| 5-15 minutes | Yellow (bold) | MM:SS |
| < 5 minutes | Red (bold) | MM:SS |
| Not started | Gray | -- : -- |
| Completed | Gray | Completed |

**Verification:**
- ✅ Updates every 1 second
- ✅ Color transitions correct at thresholds
- ✅ Display format clear and readable
- ✅ Shows "Completed" when round ends
- ✅ Proper cleanup on component unmount (no memory leaks)

### 5.6 Polling Configuration Summary

All pages now have correct 5-second polling:

| Component | Endpoint | Interval | Status |
|-----------|----------|----------|--------|
| Participant Dashboard | `/api/participants/my-credential` | 5s | ✅ |
| Participant Event Details | `/api/events/:id/rounds` | 5s | ✅ |
| Participant Take Test | `/api/rounds/:id` | 5s | ✅ |
| **Event Admin Rounds** | `/api/events/:id/rounds` | **5s** | ✅ **FIXED** |
