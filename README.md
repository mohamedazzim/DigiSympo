2. **events** - Symposium events with categories and status
3. **event_admins** - Admin-to-event assignments
4. **event_rules** - Event-level proctoring configuration
5. **rounds** - Event rounds with timing and status
6. **round_rules** - Round-specific proctoring configuration (NEW)

9. **test_attempts** - Test sessions with scoring
10. **answers** - Participant responses
11. **registration_forms** - Dynamic registration forms (NEW)
12. **registrations** - Form submissions pending approval (NEW)
13. **event_credentials** - Event-specific login credentials (NEW)
14. **reports** - Generated reports

## Data Integrity and Management

### Cascade Delete Behavior

**When an event is deleted:**
- Event admin assignments
- Event-specific rules
- All rounds (and their rules, questions, attempts, answers)
- Participant registrations
- Event credentials
- Event-specific reports

**Important Notes:**
- Admin user accounts persist for reassignment
- Creator information preserved (set to null)
- Report generator information preserved

### Validation Rules
- **Event Names**: Must be unique across the system
- **Email**: RFC 5322 compliant format
- **Phone**: Indian mobile format (10 digits, starts with 6-9)
- **Event Selection**: Max 1 technical + 1 non-technical
- **Time Conflicts**: Automatic detection and prevention
- **Category Enforcement**: Backend validation of allowed categories

## Registration Form System

### Form Builder
- **Dynamic Fields**: text, email, tel, textarea
- **Required/Optional**: Configure field requirements
- **Placeholders**: Helpful input hints
- **Live Preview**: Real-time form preview with blue header
- **Unique Slugs**: Auto-generated shareable URLs

### Event Selection Logic
```
Allowed Categories → Filter Events → Prevent Overlaps → Validate Backend
```

### Security
- Frontend filtering by allowed categories
- Backend validation of selected events
- Category permission enforcement
- Overlap detection across rounds
