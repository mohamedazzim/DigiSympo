## Security Features

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Server-side authorization checks
- Event-specific access verification

## Proctoring System

The system implements strict browser-based proctoring:

- **Begin Test Screen**: Requires explicit user gesture to activate fullscreen
- **Fullscreen Lock**: Blocks attempts to exit fullscreen during test
- **Tab Switch Detection**: Counts and warns on tab switches
- **Refresh Prevention**: Prevents page refresh during active tests
- **Violation Warnings**: Shows modal warnings for violations
- **Auto-Submit**: Automatically submits test after max violations
- **Violation Logs**: Complete audit trail for event admins

## Database Schema

The system uses 9 core tables:

1. **users** - User accounts with roles
2. **events** - Symposium events
3. **event_admins** - Admin-to-event assignments
4. **event_rules** - Proctoring configuration
5. **rounds** - Event rounds with timing
6. **questions** - Test questions with answers
7. **participants** - Event registrations
8. **test_attempts** - Test sessions with scoring
9. **answers** - Participant responses

## Data Integrity and Management

### Cascade Delete Behavior

The system implements strict cascade delete policies to maintain data integrity:

**When an event is deleted, the following are automatically deleted:**
- Event admin assignments (`eventAdmins` junction table)
- Event-specific rules (`eventRules`)
- All rounds within the event (`rounds`)
  - Round-specific rules (`roundRules`)
  - All questions in each round (`questions`)
  - All test attempts for each round (`testAttempts`)
    - All participant answers (`answers`)
- Event participant registrations (`participants`)
- Event-specific reports (`reports`)

**Important Notes:**
- **Admin user accounts persist** even after event deletion, allowing them to be reassigned to other events
- **Creator information is preserved**: If a user who created events is deleted, the `createdBy` field is set to `null` rather than deleting the event (preserves event history)
- **Report generator information is preserved**: If a user who generated reports is deleted, the `generatedBy` field is set to `null` (preserves report history)

### Admin Credential Management

Super Admins can update user credentials for any user account:

**Update User Credentials (Super Admin only)**
```
PATCH /api/users/:id/credentials
```

**Request body (all fields optional):**
```json
{
  "username": "new_username",
  "email": "new_email@example.com",
  "password": "new_password"
}
```

**Features:**
- Validates username and email uniqueness before updating
- Automatically hashes passwords with bcrypt
- Returns updated user without password field
- Useful for resetting admin credentials or updating account information

### Orphaned Admin Cleanup

Orphaned event admins are users with the `event_admin` role who have no event assignments.

**List Orphaned Event Admins (Super Admin only)**
```
GET /api/admin/orphaned-admins
```

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "admin-uuid",
    "username": "admin1",
    "email": "admin1@example.com",
    "fullName": "Admin User",
    "role": "event_admin",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-02T..."
  }
]
```

**Cleanup Strategy:**
1. Periodically check for orphaned admins using the endpoint above
2. Review the list to identify admins who are no longer needed
3. Either:
   - Reassign them to new events using `POST /api/events/:eventId/admins`
   - Delete their user accounts if they're truly no longer needed
