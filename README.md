- Visual podium display for top 3 performers
- Complete rankings table for all participants
- Accessible directly from test results page

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- PostgreSQL database

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```

4. Push database schema:
```bash
npm run db:push
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## Test Credentials

A Super Admin account has been created for testing:

**Super Admin**
- **Username:** `superadmin`
- **Email:** `superadmin@test.com`
- **Password:** `Admin123!`

Use these credentials to log in and access all administrative features including event management, user management, and system-wide reports.

- **Refresh Prevention**: Prevents page refresh during active tests
- **Violation Warnings**: Shows modal warnings for violations
- **Auto-Submit**: Automatically submits test after max violations
- **Violation Logs**: Complete audit trail for event admins

## Database Schema

The system uses 9 core tables:

1. **users** - User accounts with roles
2. **events** - Symposium events
3. **event_admins** - Admin-to-event assignments
4. **event_rules** - Proctoring configuration
5. **rounds** - Event rounds with timing
6. **questions** - Test questions with answers
7. **participants** - Event registrations
8. **test_attempts** - Test sessions with scoring
9. **answers** - Participant responses

## Development
