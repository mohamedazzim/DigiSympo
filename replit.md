## Project Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React with Vite, Wouter (routing), TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon)
- **ORM**: Drizzle
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)

### Database Schema
The system uses a relational PostgreSQL database with the following core tables:
- Users with role-based access
- Events with rounds and questions
- Proctoring rules and violation tracking
- Test attempts with scoring and integrity monitoring
- Answers with automatic grading support

## User Preferences
- Following PRD specification from attached_assets
- Using PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB (already configured)
- Building in phases as outlined in the PRD
- Strict proctoring features required (fullscreen, no tab switching, no refresh)
