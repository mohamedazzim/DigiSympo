# Symposium Management System

## Overview
The Symposium Management System is a React-based web application for managing symposium events, featuring:
- Role-based access control (Super Admin, Event Admin, Participants)
- Proctored online testing with strict integrity measures
- Event and question management
- Real-time leaderboards and reporting

  - Performance statistics
- My Tests page showing all test attempts with status

## Project Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React with Vite, Wouter (routing), TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon)
- **ORM**: Drizzle
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)

### Database Schema
The system uses a relational PostgreSQL database with the following core tables:
- Users with role-based access
- Events with rounds and questions
- Proctoring rules and violation tracking
- Test attempts with scoring and integrity monitoring
- Answers with automatic grading support

## User Preferences
- Following PRD specification from attached_assets
- Using PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB (already configured)
- Building in phases as outlined in the PRD
- Strict proctoring features required (fullscreen, no tab switching, no refresh)

## Implementation Status
**Overall Progress:** ~95% Complete
- ✅ Backend API (25+ endpoints including test attempts, answers, violations)
- ✅ Super Admin Dashboard (100%)
- ✅ Event Admin Dashboard (100%)
- ✅ Participant Interface (100%)
- ✅ Proctoring System (100% - fullscreen with user gesture, tab detection, violations, auto-submit all working)
- ❌ Leaderboard & Reporting (0% - planned future enhancement)

**Latest Fix (October 2, 2025):**
- Resolved temporal dead zone error by reordering mutation definitions
- Used `testStatusRef` to track test status for event handlers, preventing stale closure issues
- Proctoring system fully functional with all edge cases handled

## Next Steps
**Optional Enhancements:**
- Build comprehensive Leaderboard system for event-wide rankings
- Add automated Report Generation (PDF/Excel export)
- Advanced analytics dashboard for event admins
- Integration testing for role-based access control
- Performance optimization and caching
- Email notifications for test reminders and results

## Code Quality Notes
- All pages follow shadcn/ui design patterns
- Comprehensive data-testid coverage for testing
- Server-side security with role-based filtering
- Proper separation of concerns (frontend/backend)
- No dead navigation links
