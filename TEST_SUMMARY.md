## Bug Fix: Login Redirect Issue

### Problem
After successful Super Admin login, users were not automatically redirected to their dashboard. The login API call succeeded and returned user data, but the UI remained on the login page.

### Root Cause
The login page component wasn't monitoring the authentication state after the login mutation completed. The `setUser()` call from the auth context was asynchronous, but there was no mechanism to detect when the user state changed and trigger a redirect.

### Solution
Added a `useEffect` hook in `client/src/pages/login.tsx` that monitors the `user` state from the auth context. When a user becomes authenticated (user is not null), it automatically redirects to the appropriate dashboard based on their role:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (user) {
    const redirectPath = 
      user.role === 'super_admin' ? '/admin/dashboard' :
      user.role === 'event_admin' ? '/event-admin/dashboard' :
      '/participant/dashboard';
    setLocation(redirectPath);
  }
}, [user, setLocation]);
```

### Result
âœ… Login now properly redirects users to their role-specific dashboard  
âœ… Super Admin â†’ `/admin/dashboard`  
âœ… Event Admin â†’ `/event-admin/dashboard`  
âœ… Participant â†’ `/participant/dashboard`
