**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: PENDING

**Fix Required**: 
- Query the participant's registrations from the API
- Display actual count of registered events
- Make card clickable to navigate to registered events list

## üßπ CODE QUALITY ITEMS (Optional Cleanup)

### 7. Console Error Logging
**Location**: `client/src/pages/participant/take-test.tsx`  
**Issue**: Multiple `console.error()` calls for debugging  
**Priority**: LOW  
**Status**: ACCEPTABLE (Error logging is good practice)

**Locations**:
- Line 131: Fullscreen entry error
- Line 148: Fullscreen re-entry error
- Line 240: Violation logging error

**Recommendation**: Keep as-is for error tracking, or implement centralized error reporting service in production

### 8. Custom Logging Utility
**Location**: `server/vite.ts`  
**Issue**: Custom `log()` function  
**Priority**: LOW  
**Status**: ACCEPTABLE (Works fine for current needs)
