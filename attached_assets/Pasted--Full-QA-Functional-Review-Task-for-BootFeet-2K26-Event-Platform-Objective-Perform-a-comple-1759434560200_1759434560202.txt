🧪 Full QA & Functional Review Task for BootFeet 2K26 Event Platform
📋 Objective:

Perform a complete walkthrough of the entire application, specifically focusing on the Event Admin, Participant, and Round management pages. Identify and fix any broken elements, placeholder buttons, and missing or misfetched data.

🔍 Detailed Requirements:
✅ 1. Page-Wide Functional Testing

Go through each page of the platform — especially within the Event Admin and Rounds sections.

Click every button and check every link:

Identify buttons that behave like placeholders (i.e., nothing happens when clicked).

Fix those buttons by assigning proper functionality or removing them if unnecessary.

Ensure modals, forms, and actions trigger correctly on click.

📡 2. Data Integrity & API Binding

On all pages (e.g., event lists, round details, participant responses, leaderboard):

Check if all expected data is fetched and displayed properly.

Fix any missing data issues caused by broken or incomplete API responses.

Review and fix API endpoints if needed to ensure accurate and real-time data fetching.

🚫 3. Fix Missing “Begin Test” Button

The "Begin Test" button is missing on the Event Admin dashboard.

This button must be visible and functional for admins to start a round.

Upon clicking:

The timer should start for all participants.

The round should be locked for editing.

Proper events should be triggered in the backend.

⏱️ 4. Verify Round & Test Flow

Make sure rounds can be started, timed, and ended correctly.

Participants should:

See the timer count down.

Be auto-submitted when time ends.

Not be able to restart or re-enter the test once submitted.

🔐 5. Validate Participant Restrictions (Security Rules)

Check enforcement of the following:

No tab switching → should trigger auto-elimination.

No exiting full screen → same result as above.

No keyboard shortcuts allowed (Ctrl+C, Alt+Tab, etc.).

🏁 6. Post-Test Features

Ensure accurate:

Score calculation (+1 per correct answer, no negative marking)

Result display after the event ends

Leaderboard rendering with correct ranks and participant data

📌 Final Deliverables:

✅ All placeholder or broken buttons fixed and functional

✅ All missing or incorrect data issues resolved

✅ “Begin Test” button implemented and fully working

✅ All APIs tested and returning the correct data

✅ All pages reviewed and corrected for full functionality

✅ README/documentation updated if needed
