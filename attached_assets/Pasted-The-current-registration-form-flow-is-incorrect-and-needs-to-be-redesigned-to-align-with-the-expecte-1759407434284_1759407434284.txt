The current registration form flow is incorrect and needs to be redesigned to align with the expected user experience and enterprise-level standards.

üõ†Ô∏è Objective

Implement a fully dynamic, professional-grade registration form system, similar in experience to Google Forms (GForm), with robust input handling and a well-defined participant registration flow.

‚úÖ Requirements
1. Triggering the Registration Form Creation

The Super Admin should be allowed to create a registration form only after at least one event has been successfully created.

Once eligible, a ‚ÄúCreate Registration Form‚Äù button should appear on the Super Admin dashboard.

2. Dynamic Input Creation (Form Builder)

On clicking "Create Registration Form":

Super Admin should be able to dynamically add any number of input fields, using an "Add Field" button.

Each input should allow labeling, e.g.,
Label: "Enter Name" ‚Üí [Input Field]
Add Field ‚Üí adds another input dynamically.

The UI/UX should resemble Google Forms: clean, responsive, and professional.

3. Form Purpose & Structure

This is a general registration form, not tied to a specific event.

Participants fill in personal details (name, email, etc.) and select the events they wish to participate in.

The form should enforce business rules:

A participant can only select one Technical event and one Non-Technical event.

Events with time overlaps must be automatically disabled to prevent scheduling conflicts.

4. Event Selection Logic

The event list shown in the form should:

Be pulled from all existing events in the system.

Be categorized as Technical or Non-Technical. So on creating an event add a field for entering category dropdown to choose technical or non-technical.

Dynamically enable/disable based on time and type constraints:

No overlapping time slots.

Only one Tech and one Non-Tech event selection allowed.

5. Post-Submission Flow

On form submission:

The participant‚Äôs data should be stored.

The registration records should be available in:

Registration Committee Dashboard

Super Admin Dashboard

üß© Key Considerations

Ensure data integrity and a scalable structure.

The registration form should be reusable and editable by the Super Admin if needed.

Maintain a separation of concerns between event creation and form structure.

Form UI must be responsive, intuitive, and mobile-friendly.

üìò Deliverables

Fully functional registration form builder and handler.

Event selection logic enforcing constraints.

Participant registration flow integrated with dashboards.

Updated README and documentation to reflect new workflows and usage.
