Redesign the Rounds Management system to remove incorrect start time handling and ensure proper, real-time synchronization of round status between Event Admin Dashboard and Participants UI.

🔍 Current Problems

Start Time Misuse

Start time is shown automatically at round creation, even before admin starts the test.

Creates confusion because participants see Not Started while admin sees a timestamp.

Broken Status Sync

Admin clicking End Test shows Completed only in their view.

Participants still see Not Started, meaning status API is not linked correctly.

No Live Updates

Participant UI does not refresh when admin changes status.

Manual reload is required to see updates.

✅ Proposed Fix
1. Remove Start Time Field

Eliminate start time display from both UI & API responses.

Backend should no longer auto-generate startTime.

Instead, only track timestamps internally (startedAt, endedAt) for logs/analytics, not for UI display.

2. Define Round Status Lifecycle

Each round must strictly follow these 3 states:

Not Started → Default status when round is created.

In Progress → Set when Event Admin clicks "Begin Test".

Completed → Set when Event Admin clicks "End Test".

3. API Changes

Round Schema (Updated)

{
  "roundId": "123",
  "name": "Preliminary Round",
  "duration": "60 minutes",
  "status": "not_started",   // not_started | in_progress | completed
  "participants": 25,
  "startedAt": null,
  "endedAt": null
}


POST /rounds/:id/start → Sets status = in_progress, updates startedAt.

POST /rounds/:id/end → Sets status = completed, updates endedAt.

4. UI Changes

Admin Dashboard (Rounds Page)

Show: Round #, Name, Duration, Status.

Remove: Start Time field.

Actions:

Start Round (visible only if status = not_started).

End Round (visible only if status = in_progress).

Participant View

If status = not_started → "Round not yet started." (test locked).

If status = in_progress → Unlock test UI.

If status = completed → Auto-submit answers + show "Round Completed / View Results".

5. Real-Time Sync

Use WebSocket or polling API (5s refresh) so participants get instant updates.

When admin starts/ends a round, participants should see changes immediately without refresh.

📈 Expected Outcome

Start Time confusion removed completely.

Admin and Participant views always in sync.

Clear, consistent 3-step lifecycle for rounds.

Smooth experience: when admin clicks "Begin Test", participants’ test starts instantly; when admin clicks "End Test", participants’ test ends and results view is enabled.
