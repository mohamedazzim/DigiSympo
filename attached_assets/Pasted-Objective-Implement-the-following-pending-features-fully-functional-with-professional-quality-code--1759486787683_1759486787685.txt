Objective:
Implement the following pending features fully functional with professional-quality code, consistent styling, and adherence to the existing project architecture:

1. Enhanced Report Generation (HIGH PRIORITY)

Current State:

Reports exist only in JSON format.

Requirements:

Export event-wise reports in Excel and PDF formats.

Export symposium-wide consolidated report (all events combined).

Include in reports:

Participant scores per round

Round details

Leaderboard rankings

Event statistics (average score, completion rates, top performers)

Expected Formats:

Excel: Multi-sheet workbook

Sheet 1: Event Overview

Sheet 2: Round Details

Sheet 3: Participant Scores

Sheet 4: Leaderboard

PDF: Professionally formatted with:

Tables for participant scores and round details

Charts (bar/pie) for leaderboard and statistics

Event branding and header/footer

Reports must be downloadable by Super Admin and Event Admins.

Implement backend API endpoints for report generation.

Implement frontend download buttons with filters:

Select Event or All Events

Choose Format (Excel/PDF)

2. Super Admin Event Override Capabilities (LOW PRIORITY)

Current State:

Event Admins manage their own events; Super Admin has view-only access.

Requirements:

Super Admin can update event rules across all events.

Super Admin can modify or delete any question in any event.

Super Admin can override Event Admin settings (round timings, participant limits).

Implement audit trail:

Log all Super Admin overrides with timestamp, admin username, and action performed.

Frontend: Super Admin dashboard should include:

Editable list of all events

Expandable sections for rounds and questions

Clear override action buttons (Update/Delete)

Visual confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

3. Email Notifications (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

Current State:

No email notifications exist.

Requirements:

Implement email notifications for:

Registration approval/rejection

Credential distribution (username/password)

Test start reminders

Round status changes

Result publication

Certificate availability

Emails should have professional HTML templates with:

Symposium branding/logo

Clear headings and action instructions

Support bulk email sending for multiple participants.

Frontend/Admin should have an email log dashboard to track sent emails.

Implement retry mechanism for failed emails.

Use secure SMTP integration (or nodemailer with environment variables for credentials).

General Implementation Guidelines

Follow existing project folder structure.

Reuse existing React components, styles, and backend utilities wherever possible.

Maintain consistent UI styling with Bootstrap.

Ensure error handling and validation for all forms, uploads, and API requests.

Provide comments and documentation for every new function/module.

Ensure downloaded reports and emails are professional in appearance.

Backend APIs must be secure, role-protected, and optimized for performance.

Deliverables:

Backend APIs:

/reports/export → Excel/PDF, Event-wise/Consolidated

/superadmin/override → Event & Question override actions with audit logging

/notifications/email → Trigger all types of notifications

Frontend Components:

Report download page (filters, format selection, download buttons)

Super Admin override dashboard

Email notification log/dashboard

Documentation:

Usage guide for admins

API endpoint documentation

Notes:

Start with Enhanced Report Generation, then implement Super Admin Overrides, and finally Email Notifications.

Ensure cross-browser compatibility and responsive design.

Include sample data in generated reports for testing purposes.
